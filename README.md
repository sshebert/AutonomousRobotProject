# AutonomousRobotProject
Autonomous Robot Project for ECE 375 class

The purpose of this project was to create an autonomous robot that could navigate a variable obstacle course.
The robot included two brushed DC motors, a servo motor, a ping sensor, two optical encoders, and three line sensors.
The final robot was able to navigate the course with a high success rate.
